# Development Documentation Guidelines

This folder provides general-purpose patterns, lessons learned, and best practices for development and testing workflows. For project-specific results, decisions, and systematization, see the `docs/sistematizacion/` folder.

---

## Key Patterns and Lessons Learned
- For every new workflow or work plan, create a markdown file in `private/planning/` describing the plan, steps, responsible people, and success criteria.
- Use automated runners (e.g., `tests/full_flow_runner.py`) to execute main commands and collect logs for validation.
- Centralize lessons learned and technical decisions in the systematization area for future reference.


## Available Guides and Templates
Refer to the files in this folder for up-to-date guides and templates. All documentation must follow the AI Assistant Guidelines:
- Use imperative, unambiguous language (MUST, NEVER, ALWAYS).
- Name files and directories in English by default, following the naming policy.
- Validate and document all file operations and changes.
- Ensure autonomy in routine documentation and cleanup actions.
- Archive or delete obsolete files after robust validation.

For project-specific content, use the systematization folder and templates.
