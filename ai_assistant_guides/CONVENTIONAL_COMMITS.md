## ðŸš¦ MANDATORY ENTRYPOINT
**All planning, logic, and critical rules start from [AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md](../ai_assistant_guides/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md).**

> **Edit registry:** See [registry/policies/conventional_commits_edits.md](../registry/policies/conventional_commits_edits.md) for a complete log of all changes to this guide.

# Conventional Commits Guide

This guide is only for commit message standards and strategy for the AI Assistant project.
For general assistant logic, always refer to the entrypoint first.

## Commit Strategy & Documentation Requirement (Best Practice)

- **Document the file groups and proposed commit messages in the plan and related logs before executing the commit.** This step is mandatory for traceability and review.
- **ALWAYS run `git status` before staging or committing to review all changes and confirm only relevant files are included. This applies to both plan-based and autonomous actions.**
- **Commits should group logical blocks of work:** Avoid committing every micro-action. Instead, commit after completing a meaningful unit of work, such as a feature, fix, refactor, or documentation update.
- **Group by type of modification:** If possible, separate unrelated changes (e.g., refactor vs. docs) into different commits.
- **Commit at milestones or after relevant progress:** Update the plan and commit when you reach a milestone, finish a block of work, or complete a cleanup/archive.
- **Use clear, conventional messages:** Always follow the format and types below for clarity and automation.

This approach improves traceability, code review, and recovery, and is required for all contributors.

This document describes the Conventional Commits standard for commit messages. Use this guide to ensure clear, consistent, and automatable commit history in any project.

## Commit Message Format
```
type(scope?): subject

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

### Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **chore**: Maintenance, build, or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples
```
feat: add user authentication module
fix: correct typo in error message
chore: update dependencies
```

## Why Use Conventional Commits?
- Enables automated changelogs
- Improves collaboration and code review
- Makes project history easier to understand
