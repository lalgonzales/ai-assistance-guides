## Critical Operation Validation

- All delete, move, or plan closure operations must be validated and evidenced (e.g., show the result of `ls` after deleting).
- Never report success without evidence.
- If after 3 attempts validation fails, document the failure and notify.

### Example
- After deleting a file, show the directory listing to evidence that it no longer exists.
