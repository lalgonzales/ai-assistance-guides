## Purpose
Define the standard and policies for the creation and maintenance of project-specific guides.

## Policy for Project-Specific Guides

> **Specific Project Guides**

> In most cases, the main AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md is sufficient for general workflows and policies. However, if your project has unique needs, rules, or instructions not covered there, consider creating or reviewing a project-specific development guide. Only create such a guide if truly necessary; avoid duplicating information already present in the main guide.
>

> Every project-specific guide must include the following note at the top:
>
>     For general situations or cases not covered by this project-specific guide, refer to the main AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md. Use this guide only for instructions or policies unique to this project.
