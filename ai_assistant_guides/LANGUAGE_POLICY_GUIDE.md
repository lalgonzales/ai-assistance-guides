# LANGUAGE_POLICY_GUIDE.md


## ðŸš¦ MANDATORY ENTRYPOINT
**All planning, logic, and critical rules start from [AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md](../ai_assistant_guides/AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md).**

- This guide is only for language policy and usage rules in the AI Assistant project.
- For general assistant logic, always refer to the entrypoint first.



## Language Policy

- All documentation, code, templates, and permanent artifacts must be in **ENGLISH** by default.
- For chat responses: reply in the language used by the user (Spanish or English), unless otherwise requested.
- If in doubt, always use English for anything that will be stored, referenced, or maintained long-term. Chat and interactive responses should adapt to the user's language preference.
- Examples and edge cases are documented here.


### Examples
- A README, code comment, or template: **ENGLISH ONLY**.
- A plan in `private/planning/`: may be in Spanish.
- Chat or interactive response: use the language the user writes in.
