# Plan: Metadata and License Refactor (July 2025) [LEGACY]

## Objective
Improve and document the project metadata and license management, ensuring best practices and clear understanding.

## Context
- The need to improve and document project metadata in `pyproject.toml` (authors, maintainers, license, etc.) was identified.
- The `LICENSE` file is no longer necessary, as license information is managed via metadata.
- The process aimed to be didactic, explaining each decision and change, and ensuring traceability and alignment with autonomy guidelines.

## Tasks
1. Explain and document key metadata fields in `pyproject.toml` (authors, maintainers, license, etc.).
2. Remove the `LICENSE` file if not needed and record the decision in the plan.
3. Edit and validate `pyproject.toml` to ensure metadata is clear, complete, and standard-compliant.
4. Add a "License" section to `README.md` referencing the official metadata.
5. Document all decisions and changes in this plan for traceability.

## Autonomy
The assistant executed the plan steps autonomously, documenting each decision and change, and ensuring the process was traceable and aligned with project guidelines.

## Status
This plan is CLOSED and ARCHIVED. All tasks were completed, validated, and documented according to the guides. The plan is kept as legacy for traceability.
