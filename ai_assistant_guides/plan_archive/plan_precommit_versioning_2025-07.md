2. Integrate and configure Commitizen in the project (`pyproject.toml` or equivalent). ✅
3. Generate the necessary configuration files. ✅
4. Test the workflow: commit, version bump, changelog. ✅ (bump requires conventional commits, flow validated)
5. Document the process and update the conventions guide if necessary. ✅ (updated in main guide and code quality subguide)
6. Close and archive the plan. ✅


### Autonomy Notes
