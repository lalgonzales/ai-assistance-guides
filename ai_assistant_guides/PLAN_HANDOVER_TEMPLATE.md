## Plan Handover & Recovery Policy (Embedded)
> **All plans must be discoverable from the main entrypoint ([AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md](./AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md)).**
> Always link back to the main entry and relevant subguides to ensure traceability and prevent orphaned documentation.

Every plan must be self-sufficient: it should contain all the information, context, and references needed for any contributor (even if new or after data loss) to continue, validate, or close the work without ambiguity.

**Requirements for a Self-Sufficient Plan:**
- Clear objective and context.
- Up-to-date checklist of pending and completed steps.
- Explicit references to all relevant guides, files, and evidence.
- Documentation of all key decisions and validations.
- Section: "How to continue if you are new to this plan".
- Links to all artifacts, logs, and supporting material.
- Clear next steps and closure instructions.
- Current status (in progress, blocked, ready to archive, etc.).

**Policy:**
- A plan cannot be closed or archived unless it is self-sufficient and all evidence is present.
- If a plan is found incomplete or unclear after sync or handover, regularize and update it before proceeding.
- Always update the "handover" section before leaving a plan unfinished or transferring responsibility.

_This policy ensures continuity, traceability, and resilience for distributed or asynchronous work._
