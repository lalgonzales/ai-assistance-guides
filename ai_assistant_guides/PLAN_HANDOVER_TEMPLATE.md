## üö¶ PRINCIPLES FOR ALL PLANS
- Every plan MUST:
  - Follow a clear, structured route using the official template.
  - Remain clean: only the table and essential context, all evidence/logs linked from the table.
  - Be aligned with defined objectives and actionable steps.
  - Be updated as work progresses or requirements change.
  - Ensure full traceability: all outputs, logs, and decisions must be accessible and referenced.
  - Be formally closed with summary and links to evidence.
  - Use safe commit practices: review changes with `git status`, stage only relevant files, and use descriptive commit messages. See [CODE_QUALITY_SUBGUIDE.md](./CODE_QUALITY_SUBGUIDE.md#mandatory-commit-workflow) for details.

## Objective & Context
Briefly describe the goal, scope, and any relevant background.

## Checklist & Progress (Table-Based)

### Status legend (recommended values):
- ‚è≥ Pending: Not started yet
- üîÑ In progress: Being worked on
- üü° Action required: Needs a decision or integration, but does not block the rest of the plan
- ‚úÖ Completed: Finished and validated
- üõë Blocked: Cannot proceed until an external issue is resolved
- ‚ùå Cancelled: Step was discarded or is no longer relevant
- üìù Observation: For incidentals or findings that do not require direct action

Use the status that best reflects the situation. Prefer "üü° Action required" for steps that need a decision or integration but do not block the rest of the plan. Use "üõë Blocked" only for steps that truly prevent further progress.

| Step | Description | Status | Notes | Related |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Define objective and scope |  |  |  |
| 2 | List main actions |  |  |  |
| 3 | Validate results and document evidence |  |  |  |
| A | Additional findings |  | For discoveries outside the main flow |  |

- Number main steps (1, 2, 3, ...). Use letters (A, B, ...) for incidentals or transversal findings.
- All evidence, discussions, or detailed logs MUST be saved in the appropriate folder (e.g., `private/plan_logs/`, `private/error_logs/`, etc.) and linked from the table for traceability.
- This is a **MANDATORY ACTION** for plan compliance.
- Keep the plan clean and focused.
