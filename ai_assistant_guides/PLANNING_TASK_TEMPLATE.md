# Planning Task Template

> **Language Policy (MANDATORY):** All plans and documentation MUST be written in ENGLISH by default, unless a specific section or document explicitly requires Spanish. This template and all AI Assistant actions MUST enforce this policy.
> **Reference:** This plan follows the [AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md](./AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md) and [PLAN_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md](./PLAN_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md). Before asking the user, the assistant MUST validate what the plan and guide dictate.
> - If there are next steps or pending decisions, end the message with: “Do you confirm the next steps or should we adjust anything?”
> - If only reporting a change, the message should be clear and not request unnecessary confirmation.

You MUST use this template for any new task or workflow plan in `private/planning/`. It ensures traceability, evidence of execution, and continuous improvement.
