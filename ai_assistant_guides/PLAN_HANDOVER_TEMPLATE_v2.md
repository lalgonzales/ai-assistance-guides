### Status legend (recommended values):
- ‚è≥ Pending: Not started yet
- üîÑ In progress: Being worked on
- üü° Action required: Needs a decision or integration, but does not block the rest of the plan
- ‚úÖ Completed: Finished and validated
- üõë Blocked: Cannot proceed until an external issue is resolved
- ‚ùå Cancelled: Step was discarded or is no longer relevant
- üìù Observation: For incidentals or findings that do not require direct action

Use the status that best reflects the situation. Prefer "üü° Action required" for steps that need a decision or integration but do not block the rest of the plan. Use "üõë Blocked" only for steps that truly prevent further progress.

|------|-------------|--------|-------|---------|
