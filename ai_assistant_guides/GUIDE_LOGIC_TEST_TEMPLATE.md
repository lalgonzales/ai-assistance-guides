## Purpose
Document and execute logic test cases to validate the functionality, clarity, and robustness of project guides and templates. Identify weaknesses, ambiguities, and improvement opportunities.

## Test Execution Steps
1. Select a test case from the table.
2. Execute each step as described in the scenario.
3. Document the expected and actual results. If results differ, record the weakness and an improvement proposal.
4. Link evidence, logs, or files in the table for traceability.
5. Repeat for each test case.
6. Review and ensure all cases are executed and documented.
7. Link this file in the plan and closure log.

## Test Case Structure

| 7 | ARTIFACT_LOCATION_GUIDE.md | Save a log in `private/` and verify policy | Try to sync the file, check with `.gitignore` and `git status --short | grep private/` | The file should not be versioned or uploaded to git. |  |  |  | ⏳ Pending |
| 8 | CODE_QUALITY_SUBGUIDE.md | Commit following the workflow | Use `git status --short` to review changes, group relevant files, and record a descriptive message | Only relevant files are versioned, clear message. |  |  |  | ⏳ Pending |
| 9 | AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md | Consult the entrypoint before executing a critical action | Follow the checklist and consult subguide | Action validated and documented correctly. |  |  |  | ⏳ Pending |
