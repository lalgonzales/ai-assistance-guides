# Project-Specific Development Guide

This guide must only contain rules, exceptions, or workflows that are unique to this repository and not covered by the main guide.

## Local Exceptions and Rules

- **Closure and archiving of guide development plans:**
  - All development plans related to the evolution of the guide, once closed, MUST be moved from `private/planning/` to `ai_assistant_guides/plan_archive/`.
  - The archive commit MUST be general, for example: `docs: archive and close [plan name]`.
  - This ensures traceability and cleanliness, and is mandatory to maintain the history of the guide's development.

Add here any other exception, integration, or policy that applies only to this project.
