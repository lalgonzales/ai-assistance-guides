## Policy: Registry Documentation for Normative Edits

Every normative edit to `PLAN_STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` MUST be:
- Registered in this table with date, branch/commit, description, and author.
- Supported by a justification or analysis document stored in the `registry` folder (subfolder by type if needed).
- Linked directly in the table for traceability and validation.

This ensures compliance with the validation rule and maintains clear evidence for all changes.
